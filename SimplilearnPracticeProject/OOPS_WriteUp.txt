1st: I create Base class/Parent class named as Student Class.
2nd: Teacher class (Derived class/chil class) inherits the fields & methods from Student class.
3rd: Same for course ----------->all 3 steps in class
After that create object in main funtion which is entry point. Also calling method from base class 
on the derived class with help of the object.
And finally displaying the Field value stored data with help of the console.
 [Class in ClassLibrary And main in the console application}
